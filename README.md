# Warehouse Order Management System

## Overview

This project is a Java application designed to manage client orders for a warehouse. It facilitates the creation, manipulation, and management of client orders, products, and the overall order management process through a user-friendly UI interface.

## Objective

The main objective is to design and implement an application that streamlines the management of client orders in a warehouse environment. It aims to:

- Provide a UI interface with three windows for client, product, and order management.
- Utilize Javadoc for class documentation.
- Implement relational databases for data storage.
- Employ reflection techniques for CRUD operations and dynamic table header generation.
- Generate bills for every order using Java records.

## Features

- **User Interface**: Three separate windows for managing clients, products, and orders.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation using Javadoc.
- **Data Storage**: Data persistence using relational databases.
- **Reflection Techniques**: Simplified CRUD operations and automatic table header generation.
- **Billing**: Automatic bill generation for each order.

## Implementation

The application is structured around strong OOP principles, utilizing reflection, generic classes, and a layered architecture. It includes:

- **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**: Classes for managing business logic related to products, clients, and orders.
- **Data Access Object (DAO)**: Generic CRUD operations and specific DAOs for clients, products, and orders.
- **Validators**: Validation for email, price, quantity, and stock.
- **GUI**: Forms for client, product, and order management.
- **Model**: Classes representing clients, products, orders, and bills.

## Results and Conclusions

The project demonstrates the effective use of OOP concepts, making complex problems more manageable. It highlights the practical application of reflection, layered architecture, and Javadoc documentation. Future enhancements could include expanding the database and incorporating more complex queries for advanced data manipulation.
